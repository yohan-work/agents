# User Interview Skill

This skill helps the agent plan, simulate (if roleplaying), or analyze user interviews.

## 1. Planning the Interview
Define the research goal:
- **Objective**: What do we want to learn? (e.g., "Understand why users drop off at checkout")
- **Target Persona**: Who are we interviewing?
- **Recruitment Strategy**: How do we find them? (If simulating, describe the persona to simulate).

## 2. Default Interview Script
Use this template to structure the conversation:

### Introduction
- "Hi, thanks for joining. I'm [Name], working on [Project]."
- "This session is to understand your experience with [Topic]."
- "There are no right or wrong answers."

### Discovery Questions
- "Tell me about the last time you [action related to product]."
- "What was the hardest part about that experience?"
- "How do you currently solve [problem]?"

### Deep Dive
- "Why was that important to you?"
- "Can you walk me through your thought process when..."

### Wrap-up
- "Is there anything else you'd like to add?"
- "Thanks for your time!"

## 3. Synthesis & Analysis
After the interview (or inputting interview notes), generate an **Interview Insight Report**:

### Format
- **Participant Profile**: Name/Persona, Role.
- **Key Findings**: Top 3-5 takeaways.
- **Pain Points**: Specific struggles mentioned.
- **Opportunities**: Feature ideas or improvements based on feedback.
- **Quotes**: Direct, impactful quotes from the user.
